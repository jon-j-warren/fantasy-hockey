## Overview

### Foreword
This is an official overview of our fantasy hockey pool. All rules,
categories, scoring systems, prop bets, prizes, and anything to do with the
league in it's entirety will be contained here. This should always be
referenced as the source-of-truth. In case of any ambiguity in this
document, the current comissioner will have the final ruling and should make
their best attempt to follow the spirit of the law, and the ambiguity should
be promptly corrected in this document.

### Special Notes

__Rule Changes__

Rules, roster positions, categories, prop changes or any other kind of
alterations can be suggested before the season begins by any team manger and
will be considered for the league. However, once the season is underway
(officially: once the draft has begun), any rule changes that are proposed
beyond this point must be passed with support of __over__ 50% of the league.
The rule change must be posted in the official fantasy hockey Facebook group
with poll options for supporting or vetoing the proposed change. There is no
time limit for the vote; the rule can be proposed at any time and can be
accepted whenever the poll has amassed the required number of votes. Anyone
who abstains from voting will be counted towards vetoing the rule change. If
the vote ends up at a 50% split down the middle, the veto will take precendence
and the rule change will not pass.

__Collusion and Cheating__

Attempted collusion can and should be called out by anyone who sees it. The
penalty for colluding or cheating will depend on the infraction committed and
will be up to the discretion of the commissioner at the time of the infraction.
Repeated attempts at colluding or cheating will result in a ban from the
league.

__Playoff Pool__

The playoff pool is an entirely separate entity from this fantasy pool, but it
will be ran immediately following the conclusion of our regular season pool.
Playoff pool will not be hosted on Yahoo Sports (we will instead use Fantrax)
and we will be using Rotisserie format rather than Head-To-Head categories for
scoring. Buy-in for playoff pool will likely be $20, but more details will come
towards the end of the regular season. A playoff bracket (using the NHL Bracket
Challenge system) will also be set up with a low buy-in as well (likely $10).

<br />

### Suggestions
Suggestions to improve the league will be kept track here. This will change
frequently throughout the season.

* Waiver wire priority determined by average draft pick time

<br />

## The Draft

### Buy-In and Pre-Draft
This year's buy-in is located in the
[summary of important information section](#summary-of-important-info). The
buy-in amount has been set to properly allocate towards our
[prizing structure](#the-prizes). Drafts will be held in-person. Please make
your best effort to attend the draft, although it is understood that some will
not be able to attend in person, for which you will be able to join remotely.
A link to a Google Meet call will be provided on the official Facebook group
roughly 30-60 minutes before the start of the draft. Although it will not
enforced, a beer-in-hand is strongly encouraged when joining the call to avoid
ridicule from the other team managers.

<br />

### Draft Day

The commissioner will make their best effort to ensure that the date and time
chosen for the draft can accomodate the most amount of people possible (ideally
all). If you for whatever reason cannot attend the draft, or if you need to join
late or leave early, ensure that either you have someone available to complete
your draft for you, or that you set up your autodraft to avoid picking up
undesireable players.

The draft will follow the usual format of snake ordering. Each team will have 45
seconds to make their pick, and the draft will continue until all rosters have
been completely filled. Following the draft, all undrafted players will be
available to select as Free Agents immediately, and trades will become open as
well. It is uncertain as to whether or not Yahoo will count any additions
towards your first week's adds, so be careful if planning on dropping some of
your drafted players and picking up free agents.

Draft order will be determined in advance of the draft by at least 24 hours. The
ordering should be determined by complete randomness and no amount of skill or
any other external factor should influence the ordering of the draft. The method
of choosing the draft order will be determined on an annual basis, and must be
presented live on video to all team managers who wish to attend the viewing
to ensure complete impartialty and fairness. Once the order has been decided,
you must draft at that position. There will be no trading of draft positions.

<br />

## The Rules

### General Rules
* League format will be Head-to-Head Categories (same as usual)
* Roster changes can be made same-day, up until the game starts
* Teams will be allowed 3 pickups per week
* Minimum 3 goalie appearances required each week
* Waivers will last 1 day from the drop date
* Waiver priority is determined by inverse draft order (reset to last spot
  after a claim)
* Commissioner will accept all (fair) trades not involving the comissioner as
  soon as they are posted and seen
* Trades involving the commissioner will wait the full 24 hours to allow time
  to protest the trade
* Playoffs start week 23 and will involve the top 8 teams in the league
* Playoff tie-breakers are awarded to the higher seed from the regular season
* There will be four divisions to which everyone will be assigned, but
  they serve no purpose other than playing into the Team Bonding prop
* Prop violations are always in effect for __all__ teams, including eliminated
  teams during the playoffs. Teams will become locked once they have been
  eliminated to help prevent circumvention. Attempts to circumvent prop
  violations by dropping players before your team has been locked will be
  penalized.

<br />

<br />

### Props
Props will have monetary effect only and will not affect your roster, points,
or any other factors that could alter your chances of winning. Props will be
added and/or removed based on opinions from the previous year, so please
provide feedback at the end of the season and let the comissioner know which
props you enjoyed and didn't enjoy to help improve the league the following
season.

One more note for props - the most money you can lose to prop violations will
cap at __$10 per day__, and also will cap at __$30 for the season__. If a prop
violation occurs for a past date, the date of the infraction will be the day
used to check if the cap was hit. In the event where there is no day associated
with the infraction or the day that the infraction occurred is not explicitly
released, then the day that the infraction was announced will serve as the day
used to associate with the cap.

Here are the props for this season:

---

__Salt In The Wound__

If your non-played roster amasses more than 3 points in a single day, you will
be in violation of this prop. This includes both benched players and players on
your IR+ spot. Unlike in the past, this prop will track cumulative points in a
day rather than just accounting for a specific player's total for the day.
Benched goals and assists from goalies will not count towards this prop. To
spice things up a bit this season, goalies will also be included in this prop
in the form of wins. A win for a non-played goalie will result in the
equivalent of 2 benched player points, while a benched shutout will equal
4 benched player points.

The penalty for breaking this violation will result in $3 dollars owed for
every point scored on your non-played roster over the 3 point mark. For
example, if Player A is on your bench and scores 2 points one day, and Player
B is on your IR+ spot and also scores 2 points on the same day, you will be
in violation and owe $3 (for 4 total benched points). If on that same day, a
goalie was also benched on this team and earned a non-shutout win, then this
person would owe $9 total.

Keep in mind that if you pick up a player that is in the middle of a game, they
will automatically be moved to your bench and will be included in the scope of
this prop. For example, if a player is having a great night and has 4 points,
and either after the game (on the same day as the game) or during the game, you
decide to pick up that player, those 4 points will count as benched points since
the player is on your bench during that game day and you will be in violation of
this prop.

__Time Is Money__

With PIMs as a category, it's only fair that a prop be introduced to negate
the benefits of drafting enforcers in the later rounds. This prop will
penalize players who earn over 5 minutes worth of penalties in a single game.
This prop will only apply to active players that were not benched nor on IR+.
The fun part about this prop - if the violating player scores a goal during the
game, then this prop will be __completely__ negated on this day for this
player.

The penalty for breaking this violation will result in $1 dollar owed for every
PIM over the 5 minute mark. For example, if Player A on your team amasses 13
PIMs while playing, Player B amasses 5 PIMs, and Player C amasses 17 PIMs but
is benched, then you would owe $8 since only Player A amassed more than 5 PIMs
while playing. If Player A also happened to score a goal that game, then you
would owe $0 since the prop would be negated for them.

__Clean Sweep__

This prop is getting a bit of a nerf from the previous season in order to make
it more common. If you win a matchup without any losses (meaning you either win
or tie in every category), your opponent will be in violation of this prop.
This prop only applies to teams that fail to win even a single category in a
weekly matchup.

The penalty for breaking this violation will result in the opposing team owing
$10 minus $2 for every tied category in the matchup. For example, if there are
10 categories and Team A beats Team B by a score of 8-0 (meaning 8 wins and 2
ties), then Team B will owe $6.

__Performance Bonus__

If any one player on your team (excluding benched or IR+ players) scores at
least 4 goals in a single game, you will be cleared of __any and all__ prop
violations that you have incurred up until and including that day. Your running
total will be reset to $0, but you are still eligible for future prop
violations after that game.

Additionally, your prop violations will be transferred to the person that you
are currently facing in a matchup (up to $10 due to the cap rules). If two
teams facing each other each have a player that scores 4 or more goals during
the same day, then this prop will only apply to the team that scores more
total goals (across all of their active players) during that day. If both teams
have the same number of total goals during that day, then the rule will be
negated.

__Team Bonding__

Rejoice with your fellow division mates! The divisions serve no purpose other
than to use for a fun prop. Root on your division mates since their success is
now important to you too! At the end of the season, after playoffs have
concluded and the winner has been decided, each of the division mates of the
winner (excluding the winner themself) will receive half of their buy-in ($35,
or in the event of a division of 3 wins, then around $47) just for being in the
same division as the winner! If the 2nd or 3rd place finisher is also in the
same division as the winner, then their prizes will stack (first place finish
does not stack with the Team Bonding payout since first place will __always__
be in the same division as the winner (since they are the winner))

Divisions will be decided by the commissioner immediately following the
conclusion of the draft.

<br />

## The Prizes

### Top Finishers
The prizing structure will now include prizes for the top 3 finishers. They
will be as follows:
* 1st Place: $630 (9x buy-in)
* 2nd Place: $140 (2x buy-in)
* 3rd Place: $70 (1x buy-in)

I don't care if you make side deals to split the pot if you want, but know that
I will be sending out the prize amounts based solely on the structure above. If
you make a side deal with someone and they don't hold up their end of the
bargain, that's on you!

<br />

### Prop Prizes
The __Team Bonding__ prop has a direct payout that is unrelated to the total
running prop pool. That prop has funds allocated directly from the buy-in funds
and will be distributed independant of this prop pool. All of the other props,
however, will contribute directly to the running prop pool and will be awarded
to a single team at the end of the season.

Once the season (including playoffs) has concluded, a random category will be
chosen. The selection process for this category, much like the draft order
selection process, will be completely random and will be available to watch
live over video feed as well to ensure transparency and fairness. The
commissioner will decide this process at some point during the playoffs, and
every team is eligible to win.

Once the category has been randomly selected, whoever finished the season as
the leader of that category will win the entire prop violation fund. If there
is a tie between multiple people, then a second random category will be
selected as the tie-breaker between the tied individuals. If more randomly
selected categories are needed in order to break the tie, then more categories
will be randomly selected until the tie is broken.

<br />

### Last Place
Whoever ends up in last place in the league ends up with a huge responsibility.
They will be in charge of hosting next year's draft party! Since that could
actually be a fun responsibility, naturally there has to be some detriments
associated with the task. As such, the hoster will be responsible for the
following:
* Providing a venue/location to host the draft (12-16 people)
* Supplying beer (at least 2 beers per person attending the draft)
* Supplying food (your choice; pizza or wings would be ideal - not just chips!)

Before you ask, yes, this will be on your own dime. It'll be like $50-$100 to
provide beer and food so if you're too broke to afford that then just don't
come in last - simple as that! If you're participating from out of province,
then you'll need to arrange with someone else in the league to host it on your
behalf (and if you have trouble finding someone, the commissioner can always
lend a hand). Also, if you come in last and decide that you won't be
participating in the league the following season, then you will need to send
the commissioner $75 in order to cover what you'll be skipping out on.
